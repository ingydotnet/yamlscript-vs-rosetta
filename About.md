### About the ys-rc Project

[YAMLScript](https://yamlscript.org) is a relatively new programming language
and [this project](https://github.com/ingydotnet/ys-rc/) is intended to show
how things are done with it compared to some other programming languages.

When comparing these programs, keep in mind that they were all written by
different people and they are not necessarily exactly equivalent.

For example, most of the YAMLScript programs are written to be runnable with:
```
$ ys task-name.ys
```
which prints the intended results.

This is not necessarily the case for the solutions in other languages.
Many solutions just show the functions necessary to complete the task.

Also the line counts are not meant ot imply any superiority of a solution.



## Contributing

A great way to contribute to YAMLScript is to add [more YAMLScript task
solutions](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:YAMLScript#mw-pages) to
Rosetta Code.

You can use this program to compare your solutions with others.
